# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description

This project utilizes web APIs and Javascript to create an interactive quiz a user can take.
The quiz cycles through questions that are fitted in an array along with multiple choice answers.
For every wrong answer, the quiz will remove 10 seconds from the time. The user has 45 seconds to answer all questions. 
The goal is to have as much time remaining as possible at the end of the quiz.
